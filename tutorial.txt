i have to change the package name in two places in my app, inside strings.xml and inside the xml/accessibility.xml file too just try to do a full project search for the previous package name of the app for example dz.railtelecom.quiz or com.elquiz.app.prod
you can also just test on ur own apps to see if the accessibility is working and not their app preventing it



when launching the app:
always make sure that it toasts print a "i'm up" string signifying that the front service has been launched
or just check in notifications bar if it's showing "elquizz rapist is lurking"

DEBUGGING:
i had a lotta execution issues and reinstalling windows + installing the jdk mentioned above fixed the issue (uninstall all other jdks and jres through windows remove page (ur favorite one where u search remove in task bar) also remove all paths in system env including JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME, all ovem)


HELP: (resources)
check chrome bookmarks for a folder called quizzing
